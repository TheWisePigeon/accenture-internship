# DAY ONE
# First thing I learnt
Technical requirements and Functionnal requirements
## Technical requirements
Also called Non Functionnal Requirements(NFRs) they specify how the system needs to behave
Capturing NFRs is the dev's job but it's better done in cooperation with the client 
## Functionnal requirements
They specify how the system should work

# Second  
Architecture design review, in this case it was for a healthcare system

# Third 
Paas Iaas, difference between them, why and when to use them, how to choose the good one

# DAY TWO
## Javascript code review
Foreach and For loops: Foreach expects a synchronous function but For loop will wait on the result of the execution
## Python and algorythm 
Binary search algorythm

## Testing
### Unit testing
Unit testing is the low level testing where you isolate sections of the code(called units) and verify they work as intended
Most of the time these units are functions(refeered to as white box testing)
### UAT(User Acceptance Testing)
Called black box testing, performed by the end user or client to make sure that they are satisfied with the way the product works in a "real world environement"

## Security
### SMA (Security Maturity Assessment)
